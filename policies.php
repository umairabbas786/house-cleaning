                <h4 class="text-center">Payment Policies</h4>
                <ul class="p-3">
                    <li>We require a credit card on file to reserve all appointments. You may choose to pay by check or
                        credit card for your cleanings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Any </strong>changes to your payment method must be agreed on and changed by the office
                        (not the cleaning staff).</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>If paying by check:</h4>
                <ul class="p-3">
                    <li>Please include your client number on your check and leave on the kitchen counter upon arrival of
                        the cleaning crew.</li>
                    <li>If the crew does not receive a check, the credit card on file will be run for the full amount of
                        cleaning unless you make alternate arrangements.</li>
                    <li>If the service cost exceeds the check amount, the remaining balance will be run on your credit
                        card (unless prior arrangements have been made).</li>
                    <li>We charge a $25 processing fee for all returned checks.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="text-center">Karen’s Kleaning Prices are Based on Total Labor</h4>
                <p>Karen’s Kleaning prices are based on the total hours of labor required to complete the service that
                    you have requested. Additional charges above the initial estimate may occur if additional labor is
                    required to complete the service, or if you request additional services at the time of your
                    appointment. All additional charges must be authorized by both the client and the office. Please
                    note that the total amount of labor includes time spent gaining entry to the job site, unloading
                    equipment, communicating with the client, and communicating with Karen’s Kleaning management about
                    your service.</p>
                <h4 class="text-center">Karen’s Kleaning Staff</h4>
                <p>Our standard team size is 2 employees; however, we also regularly will send just 1, or a team of 3 to
                    4. The price does not change depending on how many employees we send. Please contact the office if
                    you have a requirement on team size, and we will do our best to accommodate it.</p>
                <p>On occasion, our staff may need to take a rest or meal break while at the jobsite per California law.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center">Late Cancellation Policy & Scheduling Information</h4>
                <p>We require 48hrs notice if you need to cancel/reschedule your appointment. Because we are closed on
                    weekends, Monday appointments must be cancelled or rescheduled by the previous Thursday. In order to
                    avoid being charged a late cancellation fee, please cancel or reschedule your appointment in time.
                    The cancellation fee is equal to the full price of your cleaning and will be automatically charged
                    to your credit card (unless you have made other payment arrangements). Please note that the late
                    cancellation policy also applies if the cleaning crew is unable to gain access to the jobsite at the
                    designated appointment time and needs to be rescheduled/canceled (ie. locked out of the house).</p>
                <h4 class="text-center">Communication</h4>
                <p>To ensure the best possible service, please do not leave notes or give special instructions or
                    service changes to our crews. All information regarding your cleaning service must be communicated
                    directly to the office so that the information is not lost or misunderstood.</p>
                <h4 class="text-center">Guaranteed Satisfaction</h4>
                <p>Karen’s Kleaning guarantees all our work. If you are unsatisfied with the quality of the work, YOU
                    MUST INFORM THE OFFICE WITHIN 24 HOURS. Please let us know as soon as possible so that we can
                    arrange for a crew to fix the job.</p>
                <h4 class="text-center">Cleaning Equipment & Products</h4>
                <p>Karen’s Kleaning crews will supply all necessary cleaning equipment and products. We offer standard
                    cleaning products or certified Green Cleaning products. The choice is yours, at no cost difference.
