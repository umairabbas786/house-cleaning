                <ul class="p-3">
                    <li>You may choose to pay by check or cash for your cleanings.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>If paying by check:</h4>
                <ul class="p-3">
                    <li>Please include your client number on your check and leave on the kitchen counter upon arrival of
                        the cleaning crew.</li>
                    <li>If the crew does not receive a check, the payment needs to be made by cash.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="text-center">Tuane`s Cleaning  Prices are Based on Total Labor</h4>
                <p>Tuane`s Cleaning prices are based on square feet and the type of service required that you have requested. Additional charges above the initial estimate may occur if you 
request additional services at the time of your appointment. All additional charges must be authorized by both the client and the office. </p>
                <h4 class="text-center">Tuane`s Cleaning Staff</h4>
                <p>Our standard team size is 2 employees; however, we also regularly will send just 1, or a team of 3 to 4. The price does not change depending on how many employees we send. Please contact the office if you have a requirement on team size, and we will do our best to accommodate it.</p>
                <h4 class="text-center">Late Cancellation Policy & Scheduling Information</h4>
                <p>We require 48hrs notice if you need to cancel/reschedule your appointment. Because we are closed on
                    weekends, Monday appointments must be cancelled or rescheduled by the previous Thursday. In order to
                    avoid being charged a late cancellation fee, please cancel or reschedule your appointment in time.
                    The cancellation fee is equal to the full price of your cleaning and will be automatically charged
                    to your credit card (unless you have made other payment arrangements). Please note that the late
                    cancellation policy also applies if the cleaning crew is unable to gain access to the jobsite at the
                    designated appointment time and needs to be rescheduled/canceled (ie. locked out of the house).</p>
                <h4 class="text-center">Communication</h4>
                <p>To ensure the best possible service, please do not leave notes or give special instructions or
                    service changes to our crews. All information regarding your cleaning service must be communicated
                    directly to the office so that the information is not lost or misunderstood.</p>
                <h4 class="text-center">Guaranteed Satisfaction</h4>

                    MUST INFORM THE OFFICE WITHIN 24 HOURS. Please let us know as soon as possible so that we can
